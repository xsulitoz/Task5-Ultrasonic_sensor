# Task5-Ultrasonic_sensor
Using ultrasonic sensor to give the robot permission to do actions 


In this repository you will find the following:

1- Arduino code to control the robot actions using Ultrasonic sensor

2- Snapshot of the circuit 

3- BRD file of the task

Link of the task on Tincercad: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/caK4Xhy7x5K-task-5-ultrasonic-sensor/editel

NOTE: since there is no bluetooth segment on Tinkercad, I did replace it by two leds representing the robot eyes

I hope you find it OK..
